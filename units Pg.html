				<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Now, the units of NCT are where most people get lost. The concept of this group is to be "Neo". Because of this concept nct has no set number of members and multiple sub-units. Only two sub-units have fixed members, the other two have rotational members. I'll explain further down below.</h3>

			<div class="unitsInfo">
				<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Nct 127 is one of the fixed member groups. It gets it's name from the longtitude coordinate of the city Seoul, ehich is where they are based out of.

			<div class="unitsInfo">
				<h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Nct Dream is a bit more complicated to explain. Nct Dream focuses on the feeling of youth and their dreams, hence their name. They were once a non-fixed group and had a graduation system in place. The way the graduation system worked was that once a member turned 19 they would no longer be allowed to participate in Dream and would move on to either NCT U or another group. It orginally had seven members in the begining, ranging from ages 14 to 16. They debuted in 2016 with the song <em>Chewing Gum</em>. The members consist of Jisung, Chenle, Renjun, Haechan, Jeno, Jaemin, and Mark. Mark was the first to graduate in december of 2018. Recently their group was changed to a rotational group, meaning the orginal seven stayed together as Dream, but only the members that fit the current song's concept the best would promote.</h3>
