They debuted in 2016 with the sub-unit NCT U. NCT's main concept is trying new sounds and styles, moving forward and over all being "Neo", which also is why they will continue to add new members through the years.</h3>
	<article><h3 style="font-size: 30px;">Since their debut they have released a total of seven full length albums, nineteen "mini albums" or EP's, and fourty-five singles. Every NCT song has it's own unique sound and aesthetic, none ever sound exactly the same. They keep their fans entertained by not only the new sounds but as well with their astounding music videos, which not only seems to fit the song just right but also fits the members just right as well.</h3>
